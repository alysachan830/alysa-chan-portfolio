## Hi, I'm Alysa.

I am a front-end developer from a graphic and UI/UX design background. I enjoy embracing challenges in building projects and solving problems with programming. With combing my programming skills and my professional background in design, I am confident to solve problems from both technical and user's perspectives.

## Why and how did I get into web development?

In mid 2020, I discovered my interest in coding when I was working on my first UI/UX design project in my last marketing company. Since then I started teaching myself programming through joining online community, bootcamp and writing technical articles for sharing my learning journey.
