<div class="text-primary fw-bold mb-3">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alysa.</div>

I am a front-end developer from a graphic and UI/UX design background. I enjoy embracing challenges of building projects and solving problems with programming. With combing my programming skills and my professional background in design, I am confident to solve problems from both technical and user's perspectives.

**Why and how did I get into web development?**

In mid-2020, I discovered my interest in coding when I was working on a web design project in my last marketing company. Since then I have been teaching myself programming through joining online community, bootcamp and writing technical articles for sharing my learning journey.
